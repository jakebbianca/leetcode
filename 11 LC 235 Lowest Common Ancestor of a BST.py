"""
Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Grind 75 #11
LC # 235 Easy

Solution:
time complexity = O(logn) - cut BST in half until find answer
space complexity = O(1)

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.
